      "[\"It's the most dust free product I have ever seen. Barely any dust but odour control is a major issue. That's the reason I have given 3 ‚≠ê rating.\\nClumping is good and if you see reviews saying it gets stuck at the bottom, that's because the tray is not filled above the half way mark. If you put a thin layer of bentonite, it will stick to the bottom and will be hard to scrape off. Please don't do that to your furry friends. Fill more than half of the tray and clean it at least twice in a day, preferably immediately after they finish their business. Thank you!\", \"But disappointed because of the dust. Since it's not scented litter, the bad smell spreads easily across.\\nAbsorption is quick and good. Those who are looking to buy budgeted cat litter, just go for it.\", 'I was happy to see amazon basics cat litter. However, the experience turned out to be below average.\\nPros:\\nAffordable (679 for 10 KG).\\nLooks clean and less powder.\\nCons:\\nClumping is average.\\nCat pee settles to the bottom of the litter box and scooping becomes difficult even though the litter box is filled properly.', 'Its not worthe the money if it finishes so soon. Also there is no odor control. It clumps REALLY very well, both pee and poo but pee sticks to the bottom and we have to scrape it hard. Im putting around 3inches.', 'There is no odor control and no smell for cat litter. Otherwise its good product', 'I had been using pet pattern litter for a while but my kitten always seemed to have some litter or poop stuck. This litter actually absorbs faster and my kittys paws are always clean. One problem I faced was with the delivery getting late, otherwise rest was satisfactory', \"Litter is good quality, and works accordingly, but it's without scent, but purpose is solved.\", 'Dries fast, no dust, and, no odour. Though a bit pricey than others but worth the value.', 'I would give it four stars as it clumps well and is dust free but would cut one star as it is not scented. After few uses it stinks. The product needs to be scented for better performance.', \"I have tried many clumping litters but this was the worst of all. Clumping is poor and worst of all the urine clump sticks hard to the bottom of the tray. While trying to scoop it forcefully it crumbles and ruins the purpose. Takes painful long time to clean. Works well for poop though although I don't know to educate my cats to use it for that alone. Odour control is good and it's among the cheapest available. But I definitely don't recommend this\", \"This a decent litter when it comes to budget. It has pros and cons\\n\\nPros:\\n1. It's dust free like itc claims to be.\\n2. Controls odour.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Clumping takes a lot of time.\\n2. The waste sticks to the bottom of the tray. I have added the litter 5-6 inches from the bottom but still it settles down. This makes the cleaning very difficult as it sticks at the bottom and I have to scrap it. Hence, 2/5 ratings.\", 'AmazonBasics tries to white label many products under their name. Good idea, bad execution for this item.\\nThe litter is extremely bad in quality & looks like whoever is in charge of it is doing zero QC.\\nIt absorbs moisture from the waste & instead of clumping up like a proper bentonite based material it‚Äôll instead transform into a soft, putty or clay-like substance that‚Äôs extremely hard & not to mention a highly irritating annoyance to clean up after cause you‚Äôll need to scrape it up & still it won‚Äôt be completely clean in the litter tub as it‚Äôll stick to the sides.\\nPlease do yourself a favour & skip this item. Other items even at 300 are doing a far better job & will actually clump up in an easy to clean up ball than this nasty mess known as A.Basics Cat Litter..', \"I had high expectations as most Amazon Basics products are good. The contents in the bag looked promising - small, dust free balls.\\nBut in 1-2 days it became clear that it doesn't clump properly. And my cats also did not use it as much as their old litter. Waste.\", \"I was misled by the high rating and positive reviews of this product. I did notice that those were primarily global reviews from other countries and not from India, but trusted Amazon to be consistent. Alas, the product delivered in India is just plain TERRIBLE. Does not do the job of what a cat litter is supposed to do. There is zero clumping, all the liquid goes and gets stuck at the bottom of the litter box and will crumble the moment you try to clean it. What used to take me 3-4 min with Petcrux cat litter took me more than 30 min with this Amazon Basics cat litter. I have no option but to throw 20 kg of cat litter away, it is that bad.\\nNo return or refund. Amazon says can't do anything about it since it has been over 5 days since delivery, implying that one should start using a product the moment they receive it from Amazon. Plus, it says it is upto the seller to decide now and that Amazon can't do anything. Hmmmph.\\nPS: DO NOT BUY THIS, IF YOU ARE IN INDIA.\", 'I have 9 cats and I am always looking for economically priced litter sand. Lucky for me I got my hands on this litter sand.

It is non-clumping though. Will never buy it again.', \"Impressed by Amazon Basics Cat Litter's use of natural bentonite for fast clumping and odor control. Its gentle texture is a hit with my cat, and the hassle-free cleanup keeps our space clean and fresh.\", \"Compared to Others this isn't Good. It was Taking a lot of Sand for Clumping.

So this product rating is 5out of 5 from my end', \"Our domestic shorthair, Frank, is a large 5.8kg (13lb) cat, who kept pooping outside of all the standard size litter boxes we'd buy for him. He would try to fit the long way, but his butt would constantly hang over the side or he would poop on the litter box wall, because he was too big. This box is absolutely perfect for larger cats. The sides are high so it captures any and all spray, and even if he stands the short way (with his butt facing the door) to poop, it's always in the box and not on the wall. Can highly recommend this for larger cats! We don't have a lot of space to fit a box, so we needed a corner one to save space. This was larger than we'd like (see pictures) but it works, and that's what counts.\\nYou sent\", \"I have big ol cats. Not Maine Coon level but still large kitties. (although these would work for Maine Coons). For those familiar with the Natures Miracle corner litter box, prepared to be amazed. This box is slightly larger/wider, it doesn't have those annoying brand/label stickers pasted on it that never seem to come off, and the clumped litter doesn't stick to the sides as easily as a normal litter box. I think that these boxes are also more aesthetically pleasing with the beige coloring.\", 'I have tried probably 5 or 6 different litter boxes and even used a giant plastic storage tote to try and find a good litter box for my cats. My main issue is I have one cat who doesn‚Äôt fully squat when she pees so she tends to pee outside the box on accident. Most of the litter boxes have failed to keep her from peeing outside of it. But with this covered box she hasn‚Äôt peed outside the box. I ordered a second one because I was so impressed this one worked! I‚Äôm very pleased with this litter box.', 'I like the way this fits into a corner, my cats love this for what I can only guess is the privacy...lol. I have several cats and had 2 litter boxes. I replaced one with this one and the cats use this one pretty much all time. Top easily snaps on and off for easy cleaning. Buying another. I highly recommend!!', 'I have a 15lb cat who is 19 years old. She needs room to turn around in the box and it to be sturdy enough not to move around and freak her out. The shape makes it very convenient to put in a corner so the entrance is easier for your cat to have enough room to comfortably get in and out of the box.', 'It‚Äôs hard to think of a litter box in terms of ‚Äúperfection‚Äù but if you are a cat person you know how important a good litter box is. This one (the triangle/corner box) is NEARLY perfect. Size-wise it‚Äôs the same as the Nature‚Äôs Miracle corner box, which for me is the gold standard for corner litter boxes. I think the entry is a bit shorter, which is fine for my cats, but the removal of one star is for the lip around the interior. First, I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs really necessary and second, since it‚Äôs there, it is places far too low and impedes scooping. The ridge should be a few inches higher or eliminated altogether so that when scooping against the sides there is no interruption/impediment to the scooper. I don‚Äôt not recommend this because of that, it‚Äôs still a very good litter box (especially if it has to be in a corner) for the price, but the nature‚Äôs miracle box is still #1', \"I have been looking for a big litter box for my 10lb rabbit for foreeeevvver and I finally found one that works! My rabbit is about the size of a young main coon cat and this gives her a ton of space to potty in. The sides are high but the lip is easy for her to jump over. I bought industrial trash bags to line it with bc my bun won't bite them but they fit perfectly over and make it easy to clean. If you have a big cat or house rabbit then looks no further because this is the one!\\n\\n(My rabbit is shaved for summer bc she's an angora mix, that's why she looks weird don't judge her)\", 'I loved the size and head room the cats have. They don‚Äôt have to walk over a mess to find an area to use. It is a bit flimsy and would be perfect if the plastic was a grade or two better. Definitely can‚Äôt pick it up or slide it over using the handle. It would break. Must use the bottom half to move it aside.', 'We have two litter boxes, the cats pretty much only use this one. Easy to clean, easy to put into a closet, and prevents most splatter/litter getting kicked out. You will still need a litter mat though', \"I have one cat that's the awkward type, and not quite as coordinated as our other cat. She loves the extra room in this one and it's nice that the box fits in a corner.\", 'We have two very large breed cats. We have tried many litter boxes. We always buy two. We bought two of these years ago and one is large enough to handle both cats. They are easy to clean and made in a way that they are the least messy boxes we‚Äôve had. Litter stays in the box because it‚Äôs deep enough for cats to scratch around and not have it go flying all over the floor. We just bought our third one. The first two lasted a long time. This is the only litter box we‚Äôll use. I hope they never stop making these.', 'This is a great letter box for a larger cat. Mine had a hard time spinning around and frequently \"messed\" on the sides because it lacked the space for him to turn around. I am pleased also that it is much easier to clean waste between litter changes because the lid snaps on and off so easily.', 'my daughter has one. she told me where she bought it. So of course, i had to get one. my apartment is very small so it fits', 'Love it. It‚Äôs so spacious, both the kitties love it so much they barely use the other three litter boxes now üòÖ It would have been perfect with a door .', 'This little box is very large. No complaints, no special featured to boast. It‚Äôll do the job and is a nice size for fussy (or fat) cats who like to have extra room when they use the litter box.', 'I feel like this is the Taj Mahal of litter boxes and having a red carpet with lights leading up to it would give it the best vibes. The thing is so HUGE its the perfect size for a grand entrance. I joke that I could fit a tiny arm chair and TV in the thing for my cat... if you are looking for tiny, this is not it. If you want a giant honking thing in the corner of a room that a small Yorkie can fit inside of and for a midsized dog to fit his head in perfectly to eat what he considers tasty treats... then this is the perfect litter box for you.', 'Loved that it fits into a small closet and was still big enough for my oversized cat!', 'Larger than the jumbo catit we purchased last time. Just as great and roomier.', 'It is big but fits nicely in a corner. I like that it is deep so that there isn‚Äôt any more litter kicked out of the box.', 'Great size for my two kittens.
